## Data Storeage History
Before 1950s data was stored as paper records. A lot of man power was involved.

Between 1950s and early 1960s magnetic tapes were used for storage. Tapes provide only sequential access and used punch cards for input.

Late 60s and 70s we started seeing hard disks and they allowed direct access to data. Data was stored in files and file processing system appeared.

### File Based System
It's **adequate for small applications**. There ate some drawbacks:
* Separation and isolation of data
    * Each program maintains its own set of data
    * Users of one program may be unaware of potentially useful data held by other programs
* Data dependence
    * File structure is defined in the program code
* Incompatible file formats
    * Programs are written in different languages and so cannot easily access each other's files
* Fixed queries/Proliferation of application programs
    * Programs are written to satisfy particular funcions
    * Any new requirement needs a new program
