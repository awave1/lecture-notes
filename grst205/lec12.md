## Athenian Empire

**Hellenic League** forces commanded by **Pausanias** (Spartan regent), 'liberate' Ionian polies captured by persians. Pausanias accused of Persian sympathies, flees - 478 BCE.

478/477 BCE: new **Delian League** founded (150 polies), led by Athens.

Original goal: aggressive protection from Persia.

Members contribute either ships or tribute.

From 460's BC, Athens refuses to allow secession from League, confiscates territory from 'rebelious' polies. Treasury of the league moved to Athens in 454 BC.

## Lead Up To The Peloponnesian War

- Growing fear of Athens
- 464-462: Helots revolt, Sparta appeals to Hellenic Leaguue for help
  - Athens send 4000 hoplites but rejected
- 460-455: Athens meddles in Peloponnese (Argos, Megara)
- c. 445 BCE: Athens settles _helots_ at Naupactus
- Key themes to watch for in studying Peloponnesian War
  - Like Cold War

## Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War (c. 420s - 400 BCE)

- Athenian elite citizen
- _strategos_ in Thrace (nothern Greece) 424 BCE
  - Spartans capture Amphipolis before he can arraice (423/422 BCE)
- Spoke to both sides in the conflict
- building on legacy of Heradotus
  - interest in difference between real causes atia (_aitiai_) and pretexts (_prophaseis_) for action
  - less **divine machinery**

## The Peloponnesian War (431 - 404 BC)

Sparta + allies (mainly in Peloponnese) vs. Athens + allies (Athenian Empire).

Ostensible causes of war:

- Colony Corcyra squabbles with mother-city Corinth
- Athens intervenes to help Corcyra
- Corinth appeals to Sparta + allies to fight Athens + allies

### Strategies

- 462 - 429 BCE: **Pericles** (strategos), dominant in Athens
  - Cautious strategy: Stay within long walls, rely on imported grain, attack Peloponnese with navy
  - Succeded by **demagogues** - someone who's literally leader of the people, somewhat equiv. to word populist
- Spartan kings also cautious strategy: Destroy farms in Attica, defeat Athenian allies
  - Generals: **Brasidas** (infantry), died 422 BCE; **Lysander** (navy, 407 - 404 BCE)

Eventually, Spartans win by using Persian-financed navy to defeat Athenians at sea, depriving Athens of grain. Key battle: **Battle of Aegospotami**, 405 BCE.

### Why Athenian Empire Lost

Spartans terms for Athens, after they won:

- Empire lost (democracies replaced with oligarchies)
- Limitation for Athenian army: No more than 12 ships
- Long walls torn down, to make sure Athenians can't try the naval strategy
- Oligarchy installed in 404 BCE in Athens (democracy restored in 403 BCE)

Less confidence in democracy, harsher policies for politicians.

Concentration of population within walls results in plague (430 BCE). Pericles dies 429 BCE, subsequent Athenians leaders less effective.

**Sicilian Expedition** (415 - 413 BC): Athens tries to help Egesta vs Selinus, Selinus calls in ally Syracuse.

7k hoplites survived, but got starved to death. Was possible to survive, if you knew tradegies.

Harsh treatment of allies alienates support:

- e.g. Mytilene, revilted vs Athenian Empire (428 BCE), recaptured in 427 BCE.
- 'Mytilenaean Debate' in athens about how to treat the city

## Significance of Peloponnesian War

- End of Athenian Empire and dominance
- Weakens Athenian democracy
- Sparta wins but soon loses the support of other polies
- **Leads to upheaval and uncertainty in Greece in 4th c. BCE**
  - Greek polies more vulnerable to interference from Macedon
