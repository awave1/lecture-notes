### ⌛️ Dating systems

Both systems (BC/AD, BCE/CE) are split by 0. The older, the further you're away from 0 in BC/BCE (backwards):

- AD - Anno Domini
- BCE - Before Common Era
- CE - Common Era

### 🤗 Early Greece

Two key civilizations:

1. **Minoan**: 2000 - 1400 BC
2. **Mycenaean**: 1700 - 1200 BC

Both civilizations were located in Aegean Sea area.

### 🤫 Bronze Age: 2200 - 1050 BC

Palaces were religious, economic powers.

#### Minoan: 2000 - 1400 BC

Minoans were located on island of Crete. Key palace called **Knosos** (1700 BC).

**Knosos**:

- Lightwell: hole in the ceiling
- Labytrinthine floor plan: maze-like floor design
- Central courtyard: central performance community space
- Magazines: storage in long hallways
- Settlement size: 10 km^2
- West of palace is for visitors, east for families (domestic area)
- Construction and decoration of the palace:
  - Stone masonry
  - Timber beams
  - Lightwells
  - Fresco paintings
  - Labyrinthine floor plan

**Minoan Art**:

- Bull leaping
- Snake godess
- Both were common motifs in minoan art, but lack of knowledge from knowing the meaning behind the art.

Minoans spoke **Linear A**, which is _not_ decipherable. Eventually, Minoans were taken over by Myvenaean in **1400 BC**.

#### Mycenaean: 1700 - 1200 BC

Mycenaean were influenced by Minoans. Some bones were found in Pylos.

**Mycenae**:

- Settlement size: 30 km^2
- Defensible position
- Heavy fortifications
  - **Cyclopean** nasonry: massive boulders
    - Called after **Cyclops**: one eyed giants from Greek mythology
- **Megaron**: central hall, rather than courtyard
- Same decorative style as Minoan
- Art includes more military elements

Mycenaeans spoke **Linear B**. They had strong economy, concept of mayors that were looking after people.

### 👿 Greek Dark Age: 1050 - 750 BC

Greek Dark Age marked the end of the [**Bronze Age**](#bronze-age-2200---1050-bc). Minoans and Mycenaeans were only remembered from myths. Dark Age marked the fall of Mycenaean civilization.

Greek Dark Age resulted in lack of monumental buildings, loss of literacy, and almost total disappearance of figurative art - styles became more crude. There was less trade, due to collapse of Mycenaean. Settlements became poorer and smaller.

Some echoes of Minoan/Mycenaean civilizations preserved in Greek Myths, traditions and language.

Greek Dark Age sometimes is reffered to as Iron Age due to high usage of iron in various products. Around 950 BC iron started being used more often.

### 😈 Greek Revival: 900 - 750 BC

Still a part of Dark Age but Greeks were producing more art and developed more literacy. Collapse of Mycenaean civilization produces **sub-mycenaean pottery**. It had less sophisticated decorations and was assymetrical & lumpy.

Late Dark Age sees shift to **geometric pottery**. Geometric pottery was decorated with geometric shapes called **meanders**.

**Greek Alphabet**: 800 BC

- Developed by 800 BC
- Was different from Mycenaean, not syllabic, like Linear B
- It was first script to use signs for vowels
- Derived from **Phonicians**

Greek Revival encouraged trade/contact with other peoples of Mediterranean.

### 🤝 Archaic Period: 750 - 480 BC

Shift from archaic to communal values. The concept of **Polis**: 750 BC was developed during Archaic Period. **Polis** - city state.

#### Hoplite Warfare: 8th - 7th BC

Hoplite warfare was developed around 8th - 7th BC and it is main Greek fighting style until 4th BC. Called after a shield **hoplon** - heavy rounded wooden shield, coated with bronze; about 3ft tall, covered upper body and a person beside. Other terms:

- **Greaves**: Hoplite shin guards
- **Linen Cuirass**: Hoplite chest guard
- **Sarissa**: A long spear
- **Phalanx**: Rank / group of soldiers
- **Coward**: someone who throws **hoplon**
- **Trireme** - the most effective warship used to ram, disable, or sink other ships
- Middle class was infantry
- Poor were rowers
- Formation is important

#### Increased Literacy & Artistic Achievements

#### Shift From Aristocratic Values To Communal Values

**Wanakes** were powerful kings that ruled during the [Bronze Age](#bronze-age-2200---1050-bc). **Baseileis** are chieftains that were in control of small greek communities. They existed before polis and position was justified by personal charisma, courage and leadership in battle.

During early Archaic perion, descendands of baseileis see themselves as **aristocrats** aka the best 😎; justified by ancestry.

During the archaic period, non-elite Greeks challenged aristocrats' claim to superiority. They organized themselves into cities where male citizens could participate in government, which is definition of **citizenship**. All of that called **egalitarianism** - the doctrine that all people are equal and deserve equal rights and opportunities.

#### Polis System

**Polis** is a **city-state**. Important polies were:

- Thebes
- Athens
- Corinth
- Sparta
- Rhodes

Typical characteristics of a polis:

- Temples - for worshipping Greek Gods
- **Agora** place for governemnt acivity, "gathering place", "assembly"
- Paved streets with grid pattern
- Coinage, with gods displayed on coins

Polis consisted of several organs of government:

- Assembly
- Council
- Officials

In some cities, the power and role that each have may change.

Kings were supervised by annually elected **ephors** (5 leaders of Sparta 🧙🏿‍️🧙🏾‍️🧙🏽‍️🧙🏼‍🧙🏻‍). Two ephors supervised the king that went to war

#### Athens

Athens had **democracy** (power of people). **Areopagus** - less power to aristocratic council. Assembly of all adult male citizens who can speak and vote. All adult male citizens can be jurors.

##### Strategies

- 462-429 BCE: Pericles (strategos) dominated in Athens
  - Plan:
    - stay within walls
    - Import grain
    - Attack Peloponnese with navy
  - Succeeded by 'demagogues'
- Spartan Kings also cautious strategy:
  - Destroy farms in Attica
  - Defeat Athenian allies
    - General: Brasidas (infantry, died in 422 BCE), Lysander Navy (407-404 BCE)
  - Eventually, Spartans win
    - Use Persian-financed navy to defeat the Athenians at Sea, depriving Athens of grain
    - Spartan terms for Athens:
      - Democracies replaced with oligarchies
      - No more than 12 ships
      - Long wall torn down
      - Oligarchy installed 404 BCE, Democracy stored in 403 BCE
  - Battle of Aegostami (405 BCE), Long Walls

#### Why Athenians Lost

1. Spartans terms for Athens, after they won:
   - Empire lost (democracies replaced with oligarchies)
   - Limitation for Athenian army: No more than 12 ships
   - Long walls torn down, to make sure Athenians can't try the naval strategy
   - Oligarchy installed in 404 BCE in Athens (democracy restored in 403 BCE)
2. Less confidence in democracy, harsher policies for politicians.
3. Concentration of population within walls results in plague (430 BCE).
   - Pericles dies 429 BCE, subsequent Athenians leaders less effective.
4. **Sicilian Expedition** (415 - 413 BC): Athens tries to help Egesta vs Selinus, Selinus calls in ally Syracuse.
   - 7k hoplites survived, but got starved to death. Was possible to survive, if you knew tradegies.
5. Harsh treatment of allies alienates support:
   - e.g. Mytilene, revolted vs Athenian Empire (**428 BCE**), recaptured in **427 BCE**.
   - 'Mytilenaean Debate' in athens about how to treat the recaptured city
6. After the war, Greece left vulnerable to attacks from Macedon

#### Significances

### 👨🏻‍🌾 Slavery

> pst. slavery is bad, ok.

Free birth did not necessarily equal Roman citizenship.

Slaves (**servi**) had collar tags with names of their master, in case if they ran away. Treatment of slaves depended on the law, personality of the owner & the type of work they had to do.

Slave was never a citizen and had none of the citizen's legal benefits. Slaves owned nothing.

Slavery was inherited. Treatment of slaves:

- It was legal to abuse slaves physically & sexually
- Slaves could only give legal evidence under torture

**Pedanius Secundus** owned 400 slaves and got killed by one of them. 400 slaves were crucified.

Some slaves had been trained and were **specialized** in something; developed close and trusted relationships with citizens. Many children of Roman elite were raised by slaves.

#### Freepeople

Freedpersons existed in the divide betwee freeborn citizen and slave. Freed status was the only status that was not hereditary

Roman citizens were able to free their slaves. Free slaves were called **freepeople**. Freepeople were important in Rome economy - they could acquire wealth. Citizenship was granted with formal **manumission**, the act of an owner freeing their slave.

The law allowed former masters to continue to inflict physical punishment upon ex-slaves.

Freeperson's name consisted of **praenomen** (first name), **nomen** (family name), **cognomen** (distinguishing name).

Terms:

- **Ordo**: was often used and can be translated to "rank", "class", "station", "condition"
- **Honestiores**: wealthy
- **Humiliores**: poor

The elite includes the three wealthiest classes of freeborn Roman citizens:

- **Equestrians**: those who had minimum of 400k **sesterces** (money) of annual income
- **Senatorials**: equiestrians who had been elected to a public magistracy and had gained membership in **senate**
- **Decurions**: wealthies members of urban communities outside of Rome; were eligeble for local mahistracies; amt of wealth varied from place to place.

The rest were non-elite.

#### Third Century Crisis

##### Political Problems

##### Economic Problems

Less tax revenue, massive inflation

##### Military Problems

Civil wars deplete Roman military strength. Fewer recruits from within Roman Empire, Roman army comes to rely on barbarian **foederati**, allied trives. There are also fewer resources to pay to the army.

**Serious military defeats for Roman army**:

- Emperor Decius killed in battle with goths AD 251
- Emperor Valerian captured by Sasanians AD 260

#### The Dominate: AD 284 - 476

The accession of Diocletian marks the end of the Third Century Crisis. Reorganizaion of Empire by Dicletian (**tetrarchy**):

- Empire split into 4 parts ruled by either a senior or a junior emperor
  - senior -> augustus
  - junior -> caesar
- Constantine obtains sole power, his sons split empire again
- these reforms -> fragmentation of Roman Empire split between Western and Eastern Mediterranean

The Empire was divided into two halves, an Eastern and a Western one. Each of four emperors governed one quarter of each side.

- size of army increased
  - Every army was loyal to their emperor.
- size of bureaucracy increased

System collapsed after death of Constantius. His son, Constantine was declared as the new Augustus by his own troops. Soon after, Maxentius, son of Maximian, became Augustus. After years of confusion, with more individuals claiming titles, Constantine obtains sole power.

#### Constantine's Reign

Constantine's reign best remembered not for reunification of the empire but for the roleration of Christianity.
