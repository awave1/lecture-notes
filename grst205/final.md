## ü§© Greeks

Greeks are group people who lived around Aegean Sea, all spoke ancient greek language of some form.

### Early Greece

Two key civilizations:

1. **Minoan**: 2000 - 1400 BC
2. **Mycenaean**: 1700 - 1200 BC

Both civilizations were located in Aegean Sea area.

### Bronze Age: 2200 - 1050 BC

Palaces were religious, economic powers.

#### Minoan: 2000 - 1400 BC

Minoans were located on island of Crete. Key palace called **Knosos** (1700 BC).

**Knosos**:
- Lightwell: hole in the ceiling
- Labytrinthine floor plan: maze-like floor design
- Central courtyard: central performance community space
- Magazines: storage in long hallways
- Settlement size: 10 km^2
- West of palace is for visitors, east for families (domestic area)
- Construction and decoration of the palace:
  - Stone masonry
  - Timber beams
  - Lightwells
  - Fresco paintings
  - Labyrinthine floor plan

**Minoan Art**:
- Bull leaping
- Snake godess
- Both were common motifs in minoan art, but lack of knowledge from knowing the meaning behind the art.

Minoans spoke **Linear A**, which is *not* decipherable. Eventually, Minoans were taken over by Myvenaean in **1400 BC**.

#### Mycenaean: 1700 - 1200 BC

Mycenaean were influenced by Minoans. Some bones were found in Pylos.

**Mycenae**
- Settlement size: 30 km^2
- Defensible position
- Heavy fortifications
  - **Cyclopean** nasonry: massive boulders
    - Called after **Cyclops**: one eyed giants from Greek mythology 
- **Megaron**: central hall, rather than courtyard
- Same decorative style as Minoan
- Art includes more military elements

Mycenaeans spoke **Linear B**. They had strong economy, concept of mayors that were looking after people.

### Greek Dark Age: 1050 - 750 BC

Greek Dark Age marked the end of the [**Bronze Age**](#bronze-age-2200---1050-bc). Minoans and Mycenaeans were only remembered from myths. Dark Age marked the fall of Mycenaean civilization.

Greek Dark Age resulted in lack of monumental buildings, loss of literacy, and almost total disappearance of figurative art - styles became more crude. There was less trade, due to collapse of Mycenaean. Settlements became poorer and smaller.

Some echoes of Minoan/Mycenaean civilizations preserved in Greek Myths, traditions and language.

Greek Dark Age sometimes is reffered to as Iron Age due to high usage of iron in various products. Around 950 BC iron started being used more often.

### Greek Revival: 900 - 750 BC

Still a part of Dark Age but Greeks were producing more art and developed more literacy. Collapse of Mycenaean civilization produces **sub-mycenaean pottery**. It had less sophisticated decorations and was assymetrical & lumpy.

Late Dark Age sees shift to **geometric pottery**. Geometric pottery was decorated with geometric shapes called **meanders**.

**Greek Alphabet**: 800 BC
- Developed by 800 BC
- Was different from Mycenaean, not syllabic, like Linear B
- It was first script to use signs for vowels
- Derived from **Phonicians**

Greek Revival encouraged trade/contact with other peoples of Mediterranean. 

### Archaic Period: 750 - 480 BC

Shift from archaic to communal values. The concept of **Polis**: 750 BC was developed during Archaic Period. **Polis** - city state.

#### Hoplite Warfare: 8th - 7th BC

Hoplite warfare was developed around 8th - 7th BC and it is main Greek fighting style until 4th BC. Called after a shield **hoplon** - heavy rounded wooden shield, coated with bronze; about 3ft tall, covered upper body and a person beside. Other terms:
- **Greaves**: Hoplite shin guards
- **Linen Cuirass**: Hoplite chest guard
- **Sarissa**: A long spear
- **Phalanx**: Rank / group of soldiers
- **Coward**: someone who throws **hoplon**
- **Trireme** - the most effective warship used to ram, disable, or sink other ships
- Middle class was infantry
- Poor were rowers
- Formation is important

#### Increased Literacy & Artistic Achievements

**The Illiad**:
- Covers Trojan War

#### Shift From Aristocratic Values To Communal Values

**Wanakes** were powerful kings that ruled during the [Bronze Age](#bronze-age-2200---1050-bc). **Baseileis** are chieftains that were in control of small greek communities. They existed before polis and position was justified by personal charisma, courage and leadership in battle.

During early Archaic perion, descendands of baseileis see themselves as **aristocrats** aka the best üòé; justified by ancestry.

During the archaic period, non-elite Greeks challenged aristocrats' claim to superiority. They organized themselves into cities where male citizens could participate in government, which is definition of **citizenship**. All of that called **egalitarianism** - the doctrine that all people are equal and deserve equal rights and opportunities.

#### Polis System

**Polis** is a **city-state**. Important polies were:
- Thebes
- Athens
- Corinth
- Sparta
- Rhodes

Typical characteristics of a polis:
- Temples - for worshipping Greek Gods
- **Agora** place for governemnt acivity, "gathering place", "assembly"
- Paved streets with grid pattern
- Coinage, with gods displayed on coins
- Citizen army

Polis consisted of several organs of government:
- Assembly
- Council
- Officials

In some cities, the power and role that each have may change.

##### Effects & Significances of Polis System

It encouraged communal values within a city and conflict with other polies. Polis system prompted greeks to place immense value on political participation. Greeks saw themselves as free people with the right to be involved in the running of polis.

#### Colonization

### Organs Of Government

Sparta was ruled by **oligarchy** (rule of few (rich)). **Gerousia**: more power to aristocratic council. Assembly of all adult male citizens, but they were only able to vote yes/no. Sparta had two kings **basileis**, but their power was limited, were similar to army commanders. 

Kings were supervised by annually elected **ephors** (5 leaders of Sparta üßôüèø‚ÄçÔ∏èüßôüèæ‚ÄçÔ∏èüßôüèΩ‚ÄçÔ∏èüßôüèº‚Äçüßôüèª‚Äç). Two ephors supervised the king that went to war

#### Athens

Athens had **democracy** (power of people). **Areopagus** - less power to aristocratic council. Assembly of all adult male citizens who can speak and vote. All adult male citizens can be jurors.

- **Strategoi**: military general.

### Herodotus: 440 BC

Herodotus was Greek historian. Was heavily interested in other cultures: Egyptian, Persian, Indian. Wrote a first surviving book called **Historia** üìú. Historia explained why things happened the way they did, was critical of myth, and was based on research.
