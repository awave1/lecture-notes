    - Each shield protects the soldier more or less completely
  - Soldiers were armed with:
    - **pilum**: 2 javelins for throwing 
    - **gladius**: sword for close combat
    - This enabled the Romans to resist a hoplite phalanx and a Macedonian-style phalanx armed with *sarissa*
    - **~end of 5th c. BCE**: State pay introduced
  - **From 4th c. BCE**: more flexible troop organization:
    - **legion**: ~4500 men, compromised of smaller units
    - **maniples**: smaller unit, until **late 2nd BCE**
    - **cohots**: smaller unit, new name for **maniples**
