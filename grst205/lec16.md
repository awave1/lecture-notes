@TODO: add more info from reading
```

- **Social Factors**: Romans found peaceful solutions to socio-economic friction in their society
  - Resolution of **Struggle of the orders**
    - Plebians continue to support the state
- **Diplomatic Factors**:
  - Romans harnessed the strength of defeaetd opponines. **Socii** - allies

  - **Scutum** - oblong shield, **4th c BCE**. Protected more of the body than hoplite or Macedonian shield.
    - made of wood with iron edges
    - Each shield protects the soldier more or less completely
  - Soldiers were armed with:
    - **pilum**: 2 javelins for throwing 
    - **gladius**: sword for close combat
    - This enabled the Romans to resist a hoplite phalanx and a Macedonian-style phalanx armed with *sarissa*
    - **~end of 5th c. BCE**: State pay introduced
  - **From 4th c. BCE**: more flexible troop organization:
    - **legion**: ~4500 men, compromised of smaller units
    - **maniples**: smaller unit, until **late 2nd BCE**
    - **cohots**: smaller unit, new name for **maniples**

Hannibal probably never intended to destroy Rome. His goal was to force the Romans to negotiate a better deal with Carthage.

**Romans eventually prevailed against him by**:

- Avoiding pitched battles whenever possible, using **Fabian Tactics**
  - **Fabian Tactics**: named after dictator Q. Dabius Maximus Verrucosus Cunctator
- Invading Africa to threaten Carthage even though Hannibal was still in Italy
- Retaining the loyalty of most of their Italian allies - 'Italian Manpower'

#### Outcomes and Significances

- Expansion of Rome terrirory
  - Rome gains control of Spain
- End of Carthaginian military and naval power
  - Huge idemnity to be paid for next 50 years
  - Fleet confiscated; Carthge forbidden to build navy
- Rome becomes dominant power in the western Mediterranean
- **Psychological effect**: Romans believe that Hannibal could have destroyed them. THey intervene more and more around the Mediterranean in the attempts to ward off the future threats (compare to Roman 'just war' theory)
