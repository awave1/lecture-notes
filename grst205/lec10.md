### Athenian Drama: Political Aspects

Competition involved many citizens of the polis:

- Playwrights and professional actors chosen by _archon_
- Plays funded by wealthy citizens as a public service (_choregos_)
- Chorus were amatuer citizens
- Winning playwright would be chosen by citizen judges

Stories concentrated on:

- Relationship between humans and gods
- Relationships within families
- Relationships between the family and the polis

Some tragedies were based on historical events: E.g. Phrynichus, _The fall of Miletus_ (490s C); Aeschylus, _Persians_ (472 BCE)
