## Sparta
Conquers Laconia by the end of 9th c. / Messenia 8th c. BC. Neighbours made serfs (**helots**), forced to work the land and serve in army.

Inward-looking polis: no coinage till 4th c. BC. Another way in which Sparta is unusual. They thought people will stay more loyal to the state. In some way Sparta is a conservative state: they didn't like radical changes, emphasized on stability. Sometimes, Sparta is described as totalitarin state. Children were taken away at the age of 7 and educated by the state.

Empasis on men resulted in **more rights for women**.

Sparta is a miltaristic state: by late 7th / early 6th c. BC, Spartan citizen men (**Spartiates**) focus exclusively on military training.

## Athens
Unifies Attica by mid-8th c. BCE: larger agricultural base. Athens, unlike Sparta, can be described as outward looking state: exansive trading links; exports olive oil and pottery, imports grain.

Emphasized creativity, innovation (pottery, drama, philosophy). However there were fewer rights for women. Men can just say "get out" and that would be it, women had to explain why she needs a divorce and why her husband was offensive.

Athenians had large navy.

## Organs of government
**Sparta** - oligarchy ('rule of the few')

**Sparta's choice**;
* More power to aristocratic council (**gerousia**)
* assembly of all adult male citizens can vote, but only yes/no
* There are still hereditary kings (**basileis**) but their power is limited (supervised by annually-elected **ephors**)

**Athens** - democracy ('power of the people')

**Athens' choice**:
* less power to aristocratic council (**Areopagus**)
* Assembly of all adult male citizens can speak and voote
* all adult male citizens can be jurors
* kings replaced by annually elected magistrates (**archons** and **strategoi**)

First instance of democracy in the ancient world.
