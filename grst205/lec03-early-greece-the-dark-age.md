Mycenae: Mycenaean palace/citadel (c. 1350 BCE)
* Settlement size: 30000 `$m^2$`
* Smaller area
* Defensible position
* Heavy fortifications (**Cyclopean** masonry)
* Central Hall (**megaron**) rather than courtyard
* Same decorative style as Minoan
* Art includes more military elements

> Cyclops: one eyed giant of greek mythology
