## Mycanaean Palaces
Mycenae: Mycenaean palace/citadel (c. 1350 BCE)
* Settlement size: 30000 `$m^2$`
* Smaller area
* Defensible position
* Heavy fortifications (**Cyclopean** masonry)
* Central Hall (**megaron**) rather than courtyard
* Same decorative style as Minoan
* Art includes more military elements

> Cyclops: one eyed giant of greek mythology

Mycanaeans spoke an early form of ancient Greek. Surviving texts are bureaucratic / administrative. The Minoan language and script (Linear A) remain undeciphered.


## Greek Dark Age (1050 - 750 BCE)
Archaelogists discovered the evidence of collapse and destruction throughout Greece and the Eastern Mediterranean about 200 years before. Another problem was that some areas were not destroyed, such as Athens, and some of the Cycladic islands.

Additional theories to explain the end of the Bronze Age include new weapons and technology, including the use of iron.

### Collapse of Mycenaean Civilization Results
A common explanation for the destruction at the Mycenaean sites, especially the palace/citadel itself, which was destroyed by fire, is that the fire was caused by an **earthquake**.

* Loss of literacy
* Almost total disappearance of figurative art
    * styles more crude
* End of monumental building
* No more state-level military / economic organization
* Smaller and poorer settlements
* Less trade
* Some echoes of Minoan / Mycenaen civilizations preserved in Greek myth/tradition/lenguages
