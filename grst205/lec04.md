**Overview**
1. Greek Dark Age
2. Greek Revival (Late Dark Age)
3. Archaic Period: Overview
4. Archaic Period 1: Hoplite Warfare
5. Archaic Period 2: Literature

## Greek Dark Age (1050 - 750 BCE)
Less trade due to collapse of Mycenaean civilization. That led to the end of the Bronze Age. With the end of the Bronze Age, Iron-Working **Iron Age** came. By 950 BC most weapons and tools were made of iron.

Iron is very common in Aegaen area.

## Greek Revival (900 - 750 BC)
Collapse of Mycenaean civilization produces **Sub-Mycenaean potterry**.

It has similar styles as Myc., but lumpy assymetrical less sophisticated decoration.

Late Dark Age sees shift to **Geometric Potterry**.

It's decorated with geometric shapes, called meanders.

### Greek Alphabet
Greek alphabet was developed by 800 BCE. It's different from Mycenaean, not **syllabic** (Linear B). First script in human history to use signs for vowels.

Advantages:
* Fewer symbols needed
* Phonics (more widespread literacy)
* Less ambiguity

Greek revival encouraged by increase in trade/contact with other regions/peoples of Mediterranean. Greed alphabet derived from alphabet of **Phoenicians**, people-group from ancient Near East: Syria/Lebanon.

## Archaic Period (750 - 480 BCE)

> Warriors are using *hoplon*: round shield

Can see that art has more details, contains figures (in this case male warriors).

**Major Developments**
1. Hoplite warfare
2. Increased literary / artistic achievment
3. Shift from aristocratic values to communal values
4. *Polis* system
5. Colonization

### Hoplite warfare
Hoplite warfare developed around 8th - 7th c. BCE. It's main Greek fighting style until 4th c. BCE.

![Hoplite Warrior](grst205/img/lec04/04_hoplite.jpg)

Heavy, round wooden shield *hoplon* coated with bronze, bronze greaves and helmet, bronze or linen cuirass. *Hoplon* is about 3ft, covers upper body and a person beside.

Each citizen supplies his own equipment. Middle and upper class were usually able to supply themselves with equipment.

Soldiers were fighting in ranks. Massed ranks, called *phalanx*, instead of individual fighters/chariots. Requires cooperation/communal participation. Similar to rugby/american football. Average battle during this period lasted for about an hour. Push until the other side turns around and runs away - called *trophy*. Greek definition of a coward is someone who throws away the shield *hoplon*.

### Literature: The Poet Homer (The Odyssey)
> From there we sailed with heavy hearts, and came
> to the land of the Cyclopes, a lawless, aggressive
> people, who never lift their hands to plant or
> plough, but rely on the immortal gods. Wheat,
> barley, and vines with their richly clustered
> grapes, grow there without ploughing or sowing,
> and rain from Zeus makes them flourish. The
> Cyclopes have no council meetings, no code of law,
> but live in echoing caves on the mountain slopes,
> and each man lays down the law to his wives and
> children, and disregards his neighbours
