# The Rise of the Polis (pt.1)

**Outline**
1. Archaic Period 2: Literary/artistic ahievment
2. Archaic Period 3: Aristocratic to communal
3. Archaic Period 5: Polis System

## Literary / Artistic Achievment
### Homer
Ancient greeks claimed that he was the author of two of their most cherished poems *The Illiad* and *The Odyssey*

#### Illiad: Trojan War
Was it real event? 13th / 12th c. BC. Troy was located in modern Turkey. Archaelogists discovered signs of destruction.

#### Odyssey
Return of Odysseus from the Trojan War.

These stories circulated for centuries through **oral tradition**.

Name of Homer wasn't written down until 8th/7th c. BC.

### Scultures / Art

#### Kouros
Life size sculptures of male figures (*kouros*, pl. *kouroi*).

* Appeared around 6th c. BCE, these figures inspired by **Egyptian sculptures**. They become more 'lively' and anatomically correct over time.
* One of the things that are unknown is what those figures represent/mean. Is it representation of gods? of aristocrats? Greeks were obsessed with male body.
* Funerary and religious contexts
* Reflect Greek interest in beauty of the human body

#### Kore
Life size sculptures of females. Both male and female figures were brightly painted. Colors showed that you were rich and could afford paying for that.

Major difference betwween male sculptures and female is that female scultures are dressed.

## Shift from aristocratic values to communal values
During the Dark Age, Greek communities were small and led by minor chieftains (**basileis**). The position was justified by:
* Personal Charisma
* Courage and leadership in battle

In the early Archaic Period, descendants of these rulers see themselves as **aristocrats** (the best). Justified by:
* Ancestry/Family

During the Archaic Period, non-elite Greeks challenged aristocrats' claim to superiority. Greeks organized themselves into cities where male citizens could participate in government: **egalitarianism** (The doctrine that all people are equal and deserve equal rights and opportunities)
* It's a paradox though, since women couldn't participate in governemnt, as well as slaves that existed at the time
