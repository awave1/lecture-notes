### Peloponnesian War

- **Sparta + allies (mainly in Peloponnese) vs. Athens + allies (Athenian Empire)**.
- Ostensible causes of war:
  - Colony Corcyra conflicts with mother-city Corinth
  - Athens intervenes to help Corcyra
  - Corinth appeals to Sparta + allies to fight Athens + allies

#### Strategies

- **462 - 429 BCE**: **Pericles** (strategos), dominant in Athens
  - Cautious strategy: Stay within long walls, rely on imported grain, attack Peloponnese with navy
  - Succeded by **demagogues** - someone who's literally leader of the people, somewhat equiv. to word populist
- Spartan kings also cautious strategy: Destroy farms in Attica, defeat Athenian allies
  - Generals: **Brasidas** (infantry), died **422 BCE**; **Lysander** (navy, **407 - 404 BCE**)

#### Why Athenian Empire Lost

1. Spartans terms for Athens, after they won:
  - Empire lost (democracies replaced with oligarchies)
  - Limitation for Athenian army: No more than 12 ships
  - Long walls torn down, to make sure Athenians can't try the naval strategy
  - Oligarchy installed in 404 BCE in Athens (democracy restored in 403 BCE)
2. Less confidence in democracy, harsher policies for politicians.
3. Concentration of population within walls results in plague (430 BCE).
  - Pericles dies 429 BCE, subsequent Athenians leaders less effective.
4. **Sicilian Expedition** (415 - 413 BC): Athens tries to help Egesta vs Selinus, Selinus calls in ally Syracuse.
  - 7k hoplites survived, but got starved to death. Was possible to survive, if you knew tradegies.
5. Harsh treatment of allies alienates support:
  - e.g. Mytilene, revolted vs Athenian Empire (**428 BCE**), recaptured in **427 BCE**.
  - 'Mytilenaean Debate' in athens about how to treat the recaptured city

### Significances

- End of Athenian Empire and dominance
- Weakens Athenian democracy
- Sparta wins but soon loses the support of other polies
- **Leads to upheaval and uncertainty in Greece in 4th c. BCE**
  - Greek polies more vulnerable to interference from Macedon
