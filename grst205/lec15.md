  - First Roman prose 'history' written end of 3rd c. BCE
  - Texts present founding / growth of ROme as organizad process, in gread detail
    - Most details are probably inaccurate, but some may be echoes of fact

## Rome: The Regal Period (Monarchy)
Rome was ruled by kings (**rex**/**reges**) until **509 BCE** - Rome stops being monarchy. Kingship wasn't hereditary. Kings were responsible for:
- Organizing religious rites
- Fortifying the city
- Public buildings
- Leadership in war

Aristocratic council - **senate** - chose kings and advised them. First king Romulus chose the senate. Other sources state that senate was choosing kings.

Roman poet **Ennuis** wrote a lot of poetry about Rome. Can be compared to Homer.

## Romulus as King
Roman silver coin **denarius** depicting the abduction of the Sabine Women (89 BCE).

Roman myths provide evidence for Roman cultural values:
- openness to other ethinic groups / cultures
- larger role for women than in much of greek world

- Her relatives lead a revolt and expel the kings from Rome.
- 6th - 4th c's BCE: powers of the king distributed between officials / magistrates.
  - **2 Consuls** - analog of strategois.
  - **Praetors** - military leaders, judges in the law courts.
  - **Dictator** (in emergencies) - in power only for 6 months, resign after. powers are similar to the old kings, can execute people.
- Also retained from Regal Period:
  - **Assembly** (comitia) of adult male citizens:
    - Only magistrates can speac
    - Elects magistrates
    - Passes laws: accepts or rejects proposals by magistrates
    - Votes on war and peace
    - Several different assemblies: imortant are: **comitia centuriata** and **concilium plebis**
  - **Senate** remains as advisory council for magistrates

Rome had a **mixed constitution**: elements of democracy, oligarchy, and monarchy.

## Struggle of the orders
- 5th - early 3rd  BCE: Romans not of noble birth **plebians** challenge aristocrats **patricians**. **Gibbs p. 52-53, 223-224**.
